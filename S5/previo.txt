1- 
	"A" The symbol's value is absolute, and will not be
        changed by further linking.

    "B"
    "b" The symbol is in the uninitialized data section
		(known as BSS).

	"C" The symbol is common.  Common symbols are
        uninitialized data.  When linking, multiple
        common symbols may appear with the same name.  If
        the symbol is defined anywhere, the common
        symbols are treated as undefined references.

    "D"
    "d" The symbol is in the initialized data section.

    "G"
    "g" The symbol is in an initialized data section for
        small objects.  Some object file formats permit
        more efficient access to small data objects, such
        as a global int variable as opposed to a large
        global array.
	
	"i" For PE format files this indicates that the
        symbol is in a section specific to the
        implementation of DLLs.  For ELF format files
        this indicates that the symbol is an indirect
        function.  This is a GNU extension to the
        standard set of ELF symbol types.  It indicates a
        symbol which if referenced by a relocation does
        not evaluate to its address, but instead must be
        invoked at runtime.  The runtime execution will
        then return the value to be used in the
        relocation.

    "I" The symbol is an indirect reference to another
        symbol.

    "N" The symbol is a debugging symbol.

    "p" The symbols is in a stack unwind section.

    "R"
    "r" The symbol is in a read only data section.

    "S"
    "s" The symbol is in an uninitialized data section
        for small objects.

    "T"
    "t" The symbol is in the text (code) section.

    "U" The symbol is undefined.

	"u" The symbol is a unique global symbol.  This is a
        GNU extension to the standard set of ELF symbol
        bindings.  For such a symbol the dynamic linker
        will make sure that in the entire process there
        is just one symbol with this name and type in
        use.

    "V"
    "v" The symbol is a weak object.  When a weak defined
        symbol is linked with a normal defined symbol,
        the normal defined symbol is used with no error.
        When a weak undefined symbol is linked and the
        symbol is not defined, the value of the weak
        symbol becomes zero with no error.  On some
        systems, uppercase indicates that a default value
        has been specified.

    "W"
    "w" The symbol is a weak symbol that has not been
        specifically tagged as a weak object symbol.
        When a weak defined symbol is linked with a
        normal defined symbol, the normal defined symbol
        is used with no error.  When a weak undefined
        symbol is linked and the symbol is not defined,
        the value of the symbol is determined in a
        system-specific manner without error.  On some
        systems, uppercase indicates that a default value
        has been specified.

    "-" The symbol is a stabs symbol in an a.out object
        file.  In this case, the next values printed are
        the stabs other field, the stabs desc field, and
        the stab type.  Stabs symbols are used to hold
        debugging information.

    "?" The symbol type is unknown, or object file format
        specific.

    ·   The symbol name.

	Si que es posible saber la de la variable j pero no la de la 
	variable i, ya que es una variable local. La variable j esta 
	en la zona de memoria de datos, en el bss, mientras que la i
	se encuentra en el stack.
	Suma se encuentra en:
